Welcome to my personal website hosted on GitHub!

Iâ€™ve always wanted to dive into web development, and I thought with the rapidily AI agents advancement, this would be a good opportunity to make it happen.

Some cool features implemented:
- centralized text, rounded boxes;
- synchronized color palettes;
- water-hover effects;
- text expansion on hover;

I hope you find the information insightful and engaging.</br>
Let me know what you think and happy coding! ðŸ’»
